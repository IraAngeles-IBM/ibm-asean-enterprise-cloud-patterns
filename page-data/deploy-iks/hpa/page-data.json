It creates 10 replicas of a container where each container calls CPU intensive operation in a loop.\n\n- Modify `Ingress subdomain` in `generate-load-hpa.yaml` as shown.\n  ```bash\n  ## macOS\n  $ sed -i '' s#HOST#<YOUR_INGRESS_SUBDOMAIN># generate-load-hpa.yaml\n\n  ## Linux\n  $ sed -i s#HOST#<YOUR_INGRESS_SUBDOMAIN># generate-load-hpa.yaml\n  ```\n- Run the following command from the terminal to increase load.\n\n  ```bash\n  kubectl create -f generate-load-hpa.yaml\n  ```\n\n## Monitor HPA\n\nIn a terminal, you can check the number of pods created.\n\n```bash\nkubectl get pods\n```\n\nIn the another tab, watch the HPA with the following command:\n\n```bash\nkubectl get hpa -w\n```\n\nYou will see HPA scale the pods from 1 up to our configured maximum (5).\n\nThe resource usage can also be checked through Kubernetes dashboard.
