Please refer link for more details - https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-block-storage.\n\n## IBM Cloud File Storage\n\nIBM Cloud™ File Storage is persistent, fast, and flexible network-attached, NFS-based File Storage. In this network-attached storage (NAS) environment, you have total control over your file shares function and performance.
